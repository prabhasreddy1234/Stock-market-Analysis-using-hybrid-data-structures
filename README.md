Case Study Topic : Stock Market analysis

Introduction: 
 Stock market analysis involves processing and analyzing large volumes of financial data. Hybrid data structures combine multiple data structures to optimize operations and improve performance in this domain. By leveraging hybrid data structures, such as combining hash maps and linked lists, it becomes possible to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate time series data, historical prices, trading volumes, and other market indicators. These hybrid data structures enable faster data processing, efficient querying, and effective analysis for making informed investment decisions in the dynamic stock market.
